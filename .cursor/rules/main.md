# Starter Project - Cursor Rules

You are Claude Sonnet 4 working as an AI coding agent in the Starter Project workspace. This is a Solito-based monorepo with React Native (Expo) and Next.js applications focused on cross-platform mobile/web development with a tab-based navigation structure.

## 🏗️ Workspace Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Monorepo**: pnpm Workspaces + Nx with TypeScript
- **Cross-Platform**: Solito for React Native + Next.js compatibility
- **Mobile**: Expo SDK 53 with React Native 0.79.5
- **Web**: Next.js 15 with React 19.1.1
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + Redux Saga + Redux Persist
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v7 with type-safe navigation
- **UI**: React Native StyleSheet + CSS (web) with custom theming
- **Architecture**: Feature-based packages with shared business logic

## 🎯 Core Domain Knowledge

### Starter Project Application Purpose

The Starter Project is a comprehensive cross-platform application template. Key features:

1. **Tab Navigation**: Three main tabs with PageOne, PageTwo, and Other views
2. **Cross-Platform**: Native mobile (iOS/Android) and web applications
3. **Feature-Based Architecture**: Modular feature structure for easy development
4. **State Management**: Redux-based state management with persistence
5. **Multi-language Support**: English and Hindi localization
6. **Modern Stack**: Latest React Native, Next.js, and development tools

### Key Business Logic

- **Tab Navigation**: Three-tab structure with PageOne, PageTwo, and Other views
- **Feature-Based Development**: Modular architecture for easy feature addition
- **Theme System**: Light/dark theme support with consistent color schemes
- **State Persistence**: User preferences and settings are persisted across sessions
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Shared codebase for mobile and web platforms
- **Navigation Hierarchy**: Tab-based navigation with modal overlays for settings

### Navigation Structure

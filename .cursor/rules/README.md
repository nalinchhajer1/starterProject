# Cursor Rules Directory

This directory contains organized Cursor rules for the Starter Project. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of the project to provide better organization and maintainability.

## 📁 File Structure

- **`main.md`** - Main project overview, architecture, and core domain knowledge
- **`development.md`** - Development guidelines, code style, and workflow
- **`architecture.md`** - File structure, design patterns, and data flow
- **`features.md`** - Feature development guidelines and patterns
- **`platforms.md`** - Platform-specific considerations and integrations
- **`commands.md`** - Available commands, troubleshooting, and dependency management

## 🎯 Usage

Cursor will automatically load all `.md` files from this directory as rules. The files are organized by topic to make it easier to:

1. **Find relevant information** quickly
2. **Maintain and update** specific aspects
3. **Add new rules** without cluttering a single file
4. **Share specific guidelines** with team members

## 📝 Adding New Rules

To add new rules:

1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `testing.md`, `deployment.md`)
3. Follow the existing structure and formatting
4. Update this README if needed

## 🔄 Migration from .cursorrules

This structure replaces the single `.cursorrules` file with a more organized approach that:

- **Improves maintainability** by separating concerns
- **Enhances readability** with focused content
- **Enables better collaboration** with topic-specific files
- **Supports Cursor's latest features** and recommendations
